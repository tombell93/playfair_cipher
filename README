Note: This program is not yet complete. 
The encrypt and decrypt classes are working fine, but the digraph used to crack the cipher with no given
key is not working. This is due to a currently unlocated problem with the calculation of digraph 'score'
and the hill-climbing methods. 

Feel free to play around and see what you can do.
